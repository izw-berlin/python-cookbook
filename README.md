To develop and test applications in Python different environments can be used, 
for example Jupyter-Notebooks or any of the many existing IDEs.

One example of a powerful IDE is PyCharm from NetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
The community edition can be used for free. It supports the use of Git/GitHub direct from
the IDE and is available for all important OS (Win,Mac,Linux).
