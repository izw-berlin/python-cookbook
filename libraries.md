# Libraries

A short list of the most important libraries in Python:

## SciPy
SciPy is a collection of useful libraries for Python:

* NumPy : _Base N-dimensional array package_   
* SciPy library : _Fundamental library for scientific computing_
* Pandas : _Data structures & analysis_ 
* Matplotlib : _Comprehensive 2-D plotting_ 

### NumPy : www.numpy.org
_NumPy_ contains a lot of functions for work with n-dimensional arrays in 
python:
* Creation and manipulation of arrays
* Operations on arrays
* Statistics on arrays

### Pandas : www.pandas.pydata.org
_Pandas_ contains function for structured collection of data. It allows to manipulate
and handle data in database-like fashion.

The basic structure in _Pandas_ is the _Dataframe_. A _Dataframe_ is basically a 
list of records like a table in a database. Each row can addressed with with an index
like the rows in an array. But the columns can be addressed with column names, like 
the columns in a DB table. And in difference to the arrays of _NumPy_ each column can
have a different data type.

### Matplotlib : www.matplotlib.org
_Matplotlib_ contains near everything needed to create nice diagrams or plots of 
data:
* Simple line diagrams
* Bar diagrams
* Histograms
* Scatter plots
* Heatmaps
* Box plots
* Plots with errorbars
* Polar plots
* Pie charts

And many more...

Most types of plots can also be done in 3-D.

## SKLearn - Scikit-learn : www.scikit-learn.org
SKLearn is a package that implements most of the _classic_ algorithms for machine 
learning like SVM, KNN, RandomForrest, etc. together with many useful functions to
use for machine learning.

One big advantage of SKLearn in contrast to the different libraries in R for example 
is that all algorithms use the same interface. Because all algorithms have the same
interface it very simple to test different algorithms. There must only one line of 
code that defines the model to use changed, everything else stays the same.
  
## Tensorflow / Keras : www.keras.io
Most important library for deep-learning with Python.
